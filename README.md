- Total of 1517 stations 
- Average temperature was approximately 71 degrees 
- High and low temperatures were 83 and 56 degrees Farenheit, respectively.

## Summary
Based on June and December temperature data, Oahu looks like a great place to open a surf and ice cream shop showing that it has a warm to moderate climate year round.  Other queries I would use in this analysis would be precipitation and number cloudy days vs sunny days.  People tend to be outdoors surfing and eating ice cream when the sun is out.
